# Higher-level Programming - Python, Databases & JavaScript

This repository contains programs written for the higher-level programming bootcamp at ALX School. In these projects, which began occurring in sprint two (September 2022) of the year one curriculum, I learned Python, MySQL and JavaScript. Simultaneously, I continued to reinforce and expand my skills in C and shell scripting. The specific list of projects contained follows:

1. 0x00. Python -\ Hello, World
2. 0x01. Python -\ if/else, loops, functions
3. 0x02. Python -\ import & modules
4. 0x03. Python -\ Data Structures: Lists, Tuples
5. 0x04. Python -/ More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
