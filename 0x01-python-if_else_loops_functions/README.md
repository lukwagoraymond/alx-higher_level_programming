This document stores a simple description of each file in the `0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions` directory.

- `0-positive_or_negative.py:` Asign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `number` is positive or negative.

- `1-last_digit.py:` Asign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed in order to print whether the last digit stored in the variable `number` is positive or negative.

- `2-print_alphabet.py:` Print the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

- `3-print_alphabt.py:` Print the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line except 'e' and 'q'.

- `4-print_hexa.py:` Print all numbers from `0` to `98` in decimal and in hexadecimal.

- `5-print_comb2.py:` Print numbers from `0` to `99`  in ascending order with two digits.

- `6-print_comb3.py:` Print all possible different combinations of two digits but the two digits must be different and only the smallest combination of two digits.
